  - wotlQuestion: What's it like out there in hell
    hellAnswer: 'It''s too hot. The thing that nobody tells you about hell is this:
      it''s too damn hot.'
  - wotlQuestion: So do you have air conditioning or some big fans or anything
    hellAnswer: No. The only breeze comes from the air wooshing past as ghosty grinds
      those ghastly rails back and forth for all eternity.
